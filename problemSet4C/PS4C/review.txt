My grandson is 4 years old. He will only go to the McDonald's on Allegheny Ave, Pittsburgh, PA. He gets a 'pickle burger'. It's a cheeseburger, no onions, no mustard and extra pickles. This is the only McDonald's that gives him an extra souffle cup filled with pickles. The other McDonald's we have went to say they don't have anything to put extra pickles in even if I pay extra! I would like to thank Shay today for accommodating him. If he doesn't get what he ordered, he won't eat it.
